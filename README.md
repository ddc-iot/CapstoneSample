# Capstone Sample Project

This is a sample README.md file to show an example of how a README.md can be used with your respository

## Main Project
The Most Amazing Project is the completed code for my capstone. The project features:
* A microcontroller that can read minds
* A system that is powered by stray radio waves (even if I told Steph this was not possible)
* Utilizes every component used in the IoT class
* Is invisible

### Project Components include:
1. Particle Photon 2
2. MP3 Player
3. IRobot Create 2 System
4. NFC Reader
5. Duct Tape

### 3D Designs
I would have shown the 3D designs here, but they are invisible. So, you will have to use your imagination

## Sample Code
As part of the design process, I created stand alone code for the various components. This code is in the TrialCode folder of the respository
* MP3 Player
* NFC Read and NFC Write
* MPU6050
